### Collegue Projects
- [Programming 1 Project](https://github.com/albertopingo/group_P1_CollegueClassManager): Console App in C for Managing collegue classes

- [Systems Integration Project](https://github.com/albertopingo/group_IS_IoTmiddleware):  
  Middleware serving as a central hub for diverse systems. The .NET Framework-based WebAPI acts as an IoT middleware, connecting with any app through API and MQTT subscription. Two C# test applications were developed:
    - Smart Shutter: Simulates and interacts with smart shutter devices using the WebAPI for seamless IoT testing.
    - Shutter Switch: Simulates a shutter switch, validating interoperability with diverse IoT devices. This project focuses on efficient data exchange using XML.

  **Main Concepts:**
  - IoT Middleware
  - .NET Framework
  - WebAPI
  - MQTT Services
  - C# Test Applications
  - Efficient Data Exchange (XML)
  - Real-time and Historical Data Accessibility


- [Enterprise App Development Project](https://github.com/albertopingo/group_DAE_SmartPackagesApp):
  Application for managing distribution from manufacturer, through the logistics operators, to consumer with quality control sensors.
  - Backend: WebAPI developed in Java/Jakarta. The API serves as the backend for an Enterprise App designed to manage smart packages.
  - Frontend: Client App developed in Vue.js. The frontend application interacts with the backend, providing an intuitive interface for users to manage and monitor smart packages.
  
  **Main Concepts:**
  - Enterprise App
  - Java/Jakarta WebAPI
  - Vue.js Frontend
  - Distribution Management
  - Quality Control Sensors
  - Entity Relations
  - Real-time and Historical Data Accessibility
